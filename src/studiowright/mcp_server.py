INSTRUCTIONS = """\
StudioWright drives Google Flow (images and video) and Google Flow Music (songs and
instrumentals) in the user's own signed-in Chrome, through their web UIs, using the user's
own subscriptions and credits.

- Images (Nano Banana) cost no credits; videos cost credits (the tool reports what Flow
  charges in Flow's own settings pane, not here). Ask before generating many videos.
- Each call takes real time: about 20-30 s for an image, 30-90 s for a clip.
- Calls are queued and paced per profile so Flow is not flooded. If Flow reports unusual
  activity the profile cools down (~30 min); do not retry during a cooldown.
- References and frames accept a local file path (uploaded once, then reused by content)
  or a Flow media id returned by an earlier call.
- Every result lists the saved file paths and the media ids, which later calls can reuse.
- Flow Music (music_* tools) has its own credit balance: about 5 credits per new song,
  extension, cover, replacement or variation; about 40 s each. music_library is free and
  shows the balance. Songs are referred to by the "id" values results return, or "last".
- Uploading audio or images to Flow Music needs the user's own confirmation that they
  have the rights to the files (confirm_rights); never set it on your own.
